# EquaLab *Materials*

A comprehensive reference application for materials science properties, designed to help scientists, engineers, and researchers access, compare, and contribute to a growing database of material properties.

## 🌟 Project Overview

EquaLab *Materials* provides a user-friendly interface to explore and compare the properties of various materials, including:

- Metals
- Polymers
- Ceramics
- Composites
- Semiconductors
- Nanomaterials

Each material entry contains extensive physical, mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, enabling informed material selection and comparison for research and engineering applications.

## 🧪 Features

- **Browse by Material Type**: View all materials organized by category
- **Detailed Property Cards**: Expandable cards with comprehensive property data
- **Search Functionality**: Find materials by name or short code with fuzzy matching
- **Material Comparison**: Compare up to three materials side-by-side with highlighted optimal properties
- **Community Contributions**: Add new materials through GitHub pull requests
- **Mobile-Responsive Design**: Optimised for both desktop and mobile devices

Please ensure all property values include appropriate units and are backed by reliable sources.

## 🧠 Project Background

The Materials Database was created based on an idea by Thomas Bell, an aspiring materials scientist. Thomas envisioned a comprehensive, accessible platform where researchers and students could easily access and compare material properties for both reference and research purposes. This vision has been realised as an open-source web application that can grow through community contributions, making it a valuable resource for the materials science field.
